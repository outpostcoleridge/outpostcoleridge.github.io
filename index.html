      <h5>Shorter Works & Fragments Vol II (pages 1335-1337)</h5> 
     
      <p>Throughout all Nature we find evidences of a Will and a Reason: and the Will is <em>deeper</em> than Reason. It can no more be called <em>above</em> Reason than you would describe the Tap-root of an Oak as <em>above</em> the Trunk; and it can as little oppose or contradict Reason, as the Footsole can go contrary to the Limb—or than the Stuff or matter can contradict the Form...</p>
      <p>In every creature the Will appears in Reason and by Reason—it acts in the <em>form</em> of Reason. But likewise in every creature the Will shews <em>itself</em>; i.e. the Will manifests itself as <em>Will</em>. That same Principle which we had seen in the Reason as the power of reality of Reason, makes itself known as a real Power, remaining underneath all that is resolvable into Reason, as the Basin-water of a Fountain is seen distinct from the watery Column, in which it rises, shapes, and blossoms.</p>
      <p>Hence it is, that in every product of Nature from Conch and Coral up to Man and Woman there is that which can be understood, and a somewhat that cannot be understood—things, arrangements, relations, that can be reduced to a Law, accounted for and on which we may calculate, and a somewhat that cannot be accounted for or even described intelligibly because it has its source in that which is deeper than Intelligence, and which lies undernearth all assignable Reasons and Cause, as their Common Ground.</p>
      <p>Take two lovely and interesting Faces—Mrs Gillman's for instance and Mrs Aders's (and to my notion there are few finer ones). You will find no difficulty in stating this and that feature, proportion, shade of color, in which the two faces differ, and by which you might enable a Stranger to distinguish the one from the other. But will you allow, that these contain the whole difference—or that these taken in conjunction with the points common to both faces would give you the whole impression of either face, either singly or comparatively?—Would the Sum total of all the describable or even visible differences produce in you that sense of the <em>individual</em> character of either face, which the Face itself gave you?—Certaintly not.</p>
      <p>Now from this uncommon metaphysics there may be drawn a sound common-sense and practical <em>moral</em>.—To respect the free-agency of our neighbour is a duty of common Honesty. It is his Castle, the strong-hold to which he retreats, when field and forest have changed their owner—Nay, it is his Treasure-vault, sunk into the foundation of the House, and which holds the Title-deeds of his Humanity. In the code of Conscience it is aggravated Burglary to break into it.</p>
      <p>But a noble mind will do more than abstain from doing wrong. Impose on ourselves a higher Rule. Reverence the <em>Individuality</em> of those you live among. Laugh if you like at Oddities, that are contrary to Reason, and condemn Caprices, that are most often no better than eruptions of a feverous Selfishness. For these are the results and symptoms of a want of Will—marks of a Will too scanty and lifeless to spring up and shape itself in the forms of Reason. But then be sure that what you call Odd and Capricious may not be a peculiarity connected with the individuality of the Person's Being & Character—and unintelligible to you, because its source lies deeper than Intelligence. Reverence the Individuality of your friend!</p>
      <p>To the eye of the World your Establishment may appear as a concentric Circle with many circumferential lines but only one center. But in itself it must be a close neighborhood of Centers within a swelling outline formed by the segments of the outer Circles. And the Scheme then only promises success when room is allowed for every point to have a small circumference of its own so that the contraction, to which each must consent in order to give space for the others, shall yet in no instance bring the circumferential line too close to the Center. Even to two Lovers on the point of becoming Man and Wife, I would say—Would you wish that year after year your wedding should every day commence anew?—Agree beforehand, nay, if in the fullness of your love, and one-heartedness it should require invention and contrivance, yet invent, contrive that there shall be some points, some things respecting which you are to continue single. Be assured that these exceptions will strenghten the rule—and this abstinence, these interposed Fasts of Sympathy, are most favorable to marriage's longevity.</p>
